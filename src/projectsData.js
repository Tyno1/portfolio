        DataIsolationAndMultitenancy:
          "To address data isolation and multitenancy, the system utilizes tenant-specific identifiers, such as shopId, to ensure that each tenant's data remains separate and secure. Middleware is employed to enforce data access policies and ensure that API calls are restricted to the appropriate tenantâ€™s data.",
        AdminPanel:
          "Administrative features are prominently integrated into the system, including an admin dashboard that allows shop owners to manage their shop details, customize the app appearance, and oversee product and service listings. The system also includes capabilities for managing customer reviews and feedback, ensuring high-quality interactions and service.",
        AuthenticationAndSecurity:
          "In terms of authentication and security, the system uses JWT for secure user authentication, requiring that the JWT be included in the headers of subsequent requests to validate user identity and token expiration. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is employed to ensure that each user can only access resources and perform actions relevant to their role. Data encryption is applied both in transit and at rest, with HTTPS used for data transmission and sensitive data encrypted before storage. Encryption keys are securely managed using environment variables to prevent exposure.",
